## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Driverpass is a solution to simplify the learning process for getting a driver's license. It features a learning portal for students to prepare for the test, as well as test preparation with previous questions from the driving written exam. Lastly, it features a portal to schedule on the road trainings with an instructor. 
## What did you do particularly well?
I think deconstructing roles was something that I articulated well. As each role is different, it is important to have clear definitions of what role can do.
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that wording could have been more consise. There are some parts where the audience member would have understood the sentiment, primarily because they work in the industry for the tech I was working on.
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I identify needs as a minimum value for the user. From there, implementing the products that a user would interact with is the easier. It is important to keep a user in mind as it will provide the function users need for it to become a viable product.
## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I try to write code in silos. That is to say, I attempt to work with like things to avoid confusion for future code readers. I think understanding what parts of the system is shared would greatly reduce the time designing a system, as some parts share function/form.
